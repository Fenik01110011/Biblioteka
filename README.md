# Biblioteka
The "Biblioteka" program is used to manage the library. You could add books, customers, borrow books, and the penalties that customers have for not returned books are automatically charged. The program is not finished. Currently, communication with the MySQL database is implemented, through which you can add a book to the database. A large part of the functions are programmed but not yet synchronized with the MySQL database. The program menu with all the mechanics is ready, but only some of the menu options are linked to specific functions. The project was suspended because it was being created for learning C ++ programming and there was no need to continue it after programming and learning the main mechanisms of developing this kind of application in C ++.
